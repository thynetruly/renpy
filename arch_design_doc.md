    Live2DIntegration --> PhysicsHandler
    Live2DIntegration --> ShaderManager
    Live2DIntegration --> AssetManager
    Live2DIntegration --> EventManager
```

**Diagram Explanation:**  
The UML class diagram illustrates the relationship between Ren'Py’s core functionalities and the integrated Live2D components. `RenPyCore` interacts with the `Live2DIntegration` module, which in turn manages various Live2D-specific functionalities such as model loading, animation control, lip synchronization, physics handling, shader management, asset management, and event management.

### 3.5 Recommendations for Project Structure Improvements

**Modularity:**  
Ensuring that Live2D integration is modular allows for easy updates and maintenance without affecting the core Ren'Py functionalities. Each Live2D component (e.g., `ModelLoader`, `AnimationController`) should reside in separate modules to promote single responsibility and ease of testing.

**Scalability:**  
Design the directory structure to accommodate future expansions, such as additional Live2D features or modules. Using a clear and organized hierarchy facilitates scalability and manages complexity as the project grows.

**Documentation:**  
Maintain comprehensive documentation within the project structure, including setup guides, API references, and usage examples. Placing documentation alongside relevant modules (e.g., within `library/live2d_integration/docs/`) ensures that information is easily accessible.

**Consistency:**  
Adopt consistent naming conventions and organizational patterns across all directories and files. This consistency enhances readability and reduces the learning curve for new developers joining the project.

**Dependency Management:**  
Isolate third-party SDKs and dependencies within dedicated directories (e.g., `sdk/`) to prevent conflicts and simplify dependency updates. Use environment management tools to handle library versions and dependencies systematically.

**Asset Organization:**  
Centralize Live2D models and related assets within specific directories (e.g., `assets/live2d_models/`) to streamline asset management and retrieval. Implement clear naming conventions for assets to facilitate easy identification and usage.

**Integration Points:**  
Clearly define and document integration points between Ren'Py and Live2D components. Establish standardized interfaces and communication protocols to ensure seamless interactions and reduce integration complexities.

**Version Control:**  
Use version control best practices, such as branching strategies and commit guidelines, to manage changes to the project structure effectively. Ensure that major structural changes undergo thorough reviews to maintain project integrity.

**Testing Infrastructure:**  
Incorporate testing frameworks and infrastructure within the project structure to support unit tests, integration tests, and performance evaluations. Keeping test scripts alongside their corresponding modules (e.g., within `tests/live2d_integration/`) promotes organized and comprehensive testing practices.

**Build and Deployment Scripts:**  
Include automated build and deployment scripts within the project structure to facilitate consistent and efficient project builds across different environments. Place these scripts in dedicated directories (e.g., `build_scripts/`) to separate them from core code and logic.

**Security Considerations:**  
Ensure that sensitive information, such as API keys or proprietary assets, is stored securely within the project structure. Implement access controls and encryption where necessary to protect valuable project data.

**Continuous Integration (CI):**  
Integrate CI tools and configuration files within the project structure to automate testing, building, and deployment processes. Placing CI configurations (e.g., `.github/workflows/`) within the project ensures that automated processes are version-controlled and easily manageable.

**Visual Consistency:**  
Maintain visual consistency in naming and structuring directories and files to enhance navigability. Use descriptive and intuitive names for directories and files to allow developers to locate components efficiently.

```

**Conclusion:**  
By implementing an optimized and well-organized project structure, the integration of the Live2D Cubism SDK with Ren'Py can be achieved smoothly. The proposed enhancements focus on modularity, scalability, consistency, and maintainability, ensuring that the integrated system remains robust and adaptable to future developments.

**Snippets:**

### 12.1 Model Loader

```python:modules/live2d_integration/model_loader.py
class ModelLoader:
    def __init__(self, model_path):
        self.model_path = model_path
        self.model = None

    def load_model(self):
        """
        Loads the Live2D model from the specified path.
        """
        try:
            self.model = CubismModel.load(self.model_path)
            logger.info(f"Model loaded from {self.model_path}")
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Failed to load model: {e}")
            raise e

    def get_model(self):
        """
        Returns the loaded model.
        """
        if self.model is None:
            self.load_model()
        return self.model
```

**Explanation:**  
The `ModelLoader` class is responsible for loading Live2D models from a specified file path. It utilizes the `CubismModel.load` method (assumed to be part of the Cubism SDK's Python bindings) to load the model and handles any exceptions by logging errors. This ensures that models are loaded efficiently and errors are captured for debugging.

### 12.2 Animation Controller

```python:modules/live2d_integration/animation_controller.py
class AnimationController:
    def __init__(self, model):
        self.model = model
        self.current_animation = None

    def play_animation(self, animation_name):
        """
        Plays the specified animation on the model.
        """
        try:
            animation = self.model.get_animation(animation_name)
            self.model.play(animation)
            self.current_animation = animation_name
            logger.info(f"Playing animation: {animation_name}")
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Failed to play animation '{animation_name}': {e}")

    def stop_animation(self):
        """
        Stops the currently playing animation.
        """
        if self.current_animation:
            self.model.stop(self.current_animation)
            logger.info(f"Stopped animation: {self.current_animation}")
            self.current_animation = None
```

**Explanation:**  
The `AnimationController` manages playing and stopping animations on a Live2D model. It retrieves animations by name using `get_animation` and controls playback with `play` and `stop` methods. Error handling ensures that any issues during animation control are logged appropriately.

### 12.3 Physics Simulation Handler
