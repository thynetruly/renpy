            with open(f'locales/{lang}.json', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
                self.languages[lang] = json.load(file)
        print("Languages loaded successfully.")

    def get_text(self, key):
        return self.languages[self.current_language].get(key, key)

    def switch_language(self, lang):
        if lang in self.languages:
            self.current_language = lang
            print(f"Language switched to {lang}.")
        else:
            print(f"Language {lang} not supported.")
```

*Explanation:* The Localization Manager loads translation files for supported languages, provides translated text based on keys, and allows dynamic language switching during runtime.
